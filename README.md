Markdown Notes App — short description

A fast, minimalist notes manager with Markdown support. Create, edit, and organize notes in a clean split‑view UI. Notes can be marked as completed, deleted with a smooth fade‑out animation, and are persisted locally so they survive page reloads.

Key functionality
Create & edit notes (Markdown input with live preview slot ready).
Toggle complete via checkbox; visual state with SCSS module styles.
Delete note with fade‑out transition (Framer Motion or CSS animation).
Local persistence (e.g., localStorage) for notes & UI state.
Responsive layout built with React + TypeScript + Vite; SCSS Modules for styling isolation.
Deployable to GitHub Pages (Vite base path + gh-pages script). 

Tech stack (as used here)
React + TypeScript (componentized UI, typed props/state).
Vite (fast dev & build).
SCSS Modules (scoped styles, BEM‑ish class names).
Optional: Framer Motion for micro‑animations (fade‑out on delete).
GitHub Pages for static hosting.
